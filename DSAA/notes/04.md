# Convolution 
	y(n) = T(x(n)) = sum(x(k)*h(n-k))
	sum for k 

	eg. 
	x[n] = [1,2,3,1]
	h[n] = [1,2,1,-1]

	optimaztion problem would be to solve h[n]


# How convolution of 2 array of length a and b then what will be the length of the convolution ? 

## Helpes to find out the padding even for CNN

# Sliding Window always after flipping solves the problem 

# Exam trick 
   1  2  3  1
 1 1  2  3  1
 2 2  4  6  2
 1 1  2  3  1
-1-1 -2 -3 -1

y = [1,4,8,8,3,-2]
