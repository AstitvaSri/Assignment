# Signal and System 
	Sytems which is real time => 
	eg. A moving average can be a real time system
# Causal and non-causal 
	y(n) = x(n) + 2x(n-1)
	
	These are real time systems 
	Which uses its previous values

	Non-causal uses future values

# Static/Dynamic
	Static => memoryless
	Using values only at that timestamp and nothing else 
	Dynamic => Needs memory 

# Linear Systems  
	Property of additivity 
	x1 => y1
	x2 => y2
	--------
	x1 + x2 => y1 + y2 

	Homogenity 
	a*x1 => a*y1

	If these are satisfied then the system is linear 

	eg. y(n) = x(n) + 2x(n-1)

	If we give z(n) = x1(n) + x2(n)

	and y(n) = func(z(n))
	if it is y1(n) and y2(n) then it is additive 


# Time Invariance 
	x(n) => y(n)
	x(n-no) => y(n-no)
	Non time invarient system eg. Travelling in traffic
	
### Question 1
	y(n) = x(n) + x(n-1)
	z(n) = x(n-no)

	y(n-no) => z(n) + z(n-1)
	y(n-no) => x(n-no) + x(n-1 - no)

### Question 2 
	y(n) = x(n^2)
	y(n - no) = x(n^2 -no)

	z(n) = x(n-no)
	y(n) = z(n^2)
	y(n-no) = z((n-no)^2)

	Hence not time invarient

# LTI System 
	
## Impulse Response 
	sent delta function
	and we get h(n) 
	Hence using a delta value we can understand fully characterize an LTI System.

	eg. x(n) = sum(x(k)*delta(n-k))
	Let T be an LTI system

	T(x(n)) = T(sum(x(k)*delta(n-k)) 
			= sum(T(x(k)*delta(n-k)))
			= sum(x(k)*T(delta(n-k)))
			= sum(x(k)*h(n-k))

	This is called the convolution operation
	y(n) = T(x(n)) = sum(x(k)*h(n-k))		
Note => read about it

# Difference Equations 
	y[n] = x[n] + x[n-1]
