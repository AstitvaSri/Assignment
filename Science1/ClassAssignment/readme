Problem 1:
	usage: python3 Problem1.py
		   replace N = for no of steps
		   replace M = for no of iterations 	

	procedure: 
		We do M experiments of N steps
		Where we check if the 2 walkers randomly meet at a step 
		If they do then we add the count of meeting at that step

		For analytical we calculate the probablity of meeting at that step and multiply it by M to scale the analytical with the computational result.

Problem 2:
	usage: python3 Problem2.py
	
	procedure:
