# Inverse CDF
- The plot clearly shows 2 functions for each graph 

    1. Original function(Given)
    2. Computed random function(** Using histogram of inverse cdf produced using a uniform distribuition) 

# Random Distribuition 
    We will notice it is taking shape of a gaussian function or normal distribuiton.
    This is because these functions is calculated using the inverse cdf
    of a normal distribution's histogram or (p(x)).
